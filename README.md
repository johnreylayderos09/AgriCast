ðŸŒ± AgriCast 

AgriCast is a machine learningâ€“powered crop forecasting system that predicts the survivability and suitability of crops in specific regions based on soil properties (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, organic matter, etc.), climate, and location data.

The system helps farmers, researchers, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to:

Identify the most suitable crops for a given area

Improve yield potential

Reduce risks from poor soilâ€“crop matching
